"""
 Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fâ‚™, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence,
 such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. 
 That is, and for n > 1. The sequence starts: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144

n1, n2 = 0, 1 # given count to the first 2 terms
count = 0

# to check a number is a postive number and is valid
if nterms <= 0 :
    print ("Please enter a positve number ")
elif nterms == 1:
    print ("Fibonacci sequence upto" ,nterms,":")
    print(n1)
# to execute the fibonacci sequence
else: # this executes when it is false for all the above conditions
    print ("fibonacci series")
    while count < nterms:
